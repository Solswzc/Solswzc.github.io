# Introduction of my new website
&ensp;&ensp;I am believe in the power of regulations. Compared to free lifestyle, it is more stable.
 I have tried many ways to set up my regulation systems, such as Youdaoyun notes, Zine, WPS notes, Lofter and so on.
But they are not perfect.I like succinct and suitable user interface. And I perfer the form of blog.
So I have a idea of setting up my own website. I chose github because it's free and simple. A good DNS is not important to me.
I don't expect to have others see my articles. 

&ensp;&ensp;I'd like to divide my future website into three partsï¼š
1. **Regular reports**
   - **Weekly reports**. It's most frequent and important report. So how to simplify the content is vital. 
   I should considerate from some aspects. It's no doubt to choose some datas and indexs to qualify my life. 
   
   
   - **Monthly reports**
   - **Annual reports**
